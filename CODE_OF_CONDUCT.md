# Code of Conduct

GitHub advices to provide a Code of conduct. I obey. Here you are.

Please just give valuable feedbacks and contributions. I prefer positive
attitude against bad-looking code, bugs or lack of feature.

ldap2pg is a about software, not moral. We don't care about your opinions or
situation. You can be an asshole in your life. Everyone is the asshole of
someone afterall. Just don't pollute the project and other contributors with
that.

It's just common sense. That's all we need to build kickass free software.
