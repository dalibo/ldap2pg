# ldap2pg 6.1

!!! warning "Running ldap2pg unprivileged"

    Postgres 16 heavily changed the behaviour when creating roles with an unprivileged role having CREATEROLE option.
    Giving CREATEROLE to an unprivileged role before Postgres 16 was actually flawed.
    The way it's handling is so distinct that keeping the two implementation does not worth the price.

- **BREAKING** Refuses to run unprivileged before Postgres 16.
- Refuse empty LDAP URI or BINDDN.
- Case-less access to LDAP attribute and RDN.
- Fix hardwired global default privileges not inspected.
- Don't want default privileges on self.
- Restore LDAP HA: ldap2pg retries next directory in LDAPURI parameter.
- Accept -C option to specify the working folder.
- Accept DSN in CLI argument.
- Execute arbitrary SQL snippet before and after role creation.
- Escape attribute with : `{sAMAccountName.identifier()}` and `{sAMAccountName.string()}`.
- Load .env file.
- Support [NO_COLOR](https://no-color.org/) env var.
- Continue on error. E.g. if a DROP ROLE fails.
- Log Postgres out of band warnings.
- Suggest --verbose on error and --real on dry run with changes.
- Show pid in starting log message.
- New final metrics: roles count, grants count, inspect time.
- Stop calling whoami LDAP extended operation.
- Build RHEL 9 package with Rockylinux 9.



# ldap2pg 6.0

6.0 is a major release including a complete rewrite of ldap2pg in Go.

Please carefully test before upgrading on production system.

**Breaking changes**

- Command line options have changed.
- New format version: 6. ldap2pg refuses version 5 files.
- `LDAPUSER` env var is now `LDAPSASL_AUTHCID`.
- Dropped support for PostgreSQL 9.4.
- Dropped case renaming of role. e.g. from alice to ALICE. ldap2pg is still case sensitive.
- Dropped `owners_query` for a new dynamic owner inspection.
- Dropped STARTTLS. Use `ldaps://` uri instead.
- Non implemented features:
    - `role_match` condition.
    - `allowed_missing_attributes` and LDAP attribute typo detection.
    - `on_unexpected_dn`. ldap2pg always warn and skip.
    - configuring PostgreSQL connexion through `postgres:dsn`. Use PG* env var.
    - configuring LDAP connexion through `ldap` dict. Use LDAP* env vars and ldaprc.
- A single sub-search is supported per main LDAP search.
- No custom privileges inspection.
- Docker image is now based on Alpine Linux 3.18.
- Docker image tag latest points to last stable image.
- Docker image tag nightly points to last commit on master.
- Refuse to grant privilege on unmanaged role.

Unimplemented feature may be reimplemented depending on feedback!


**New features and behaviour**

- logfmt output.
- New `role:config` section allowing to set per role PostgreSQL parameter. For all databases only.
- Managed roles can now inherit local role.
- New `--skip-privilege` option. Ignore privileges and grant from configuration.
- New `owner` field of `grant` rule, default to `__auto__`.
- New `__auto__` owner value.
- Inspect object owners **after** `CREATE` privilege is synchronized.
  It's the set of all managed roles having `CREATE` privilege on the target schema of the grant.
- Default database inspection restricted to those running user can reassign objects to owner.
- Default schema inspection restricted to usable ones by running user.
- New privilege managed: LANGUAGE.
- New expressive declaration of privilege in configuration.
- Use a single database connexion at a time. ldap2pg scales better with the number of databases.
- Synchronize privileges one at a time, saving a lot of memory.
- 40 times less memory consumed for usual scenario.
- up to 3 times less CPU consumed for usual scenario.
- Debian and Alpine packages alongside RPM.
- Docker image sizes now 17MB instead of 126MB.

  Zuromskis](https://github.com/zurikus) for the report.

- Fix void attributes raising *Missing attribute error*.
- Docker image now ensure ldap2pg is pinned to the desired version.
- Moved to new homepage : [labs.dalibo.com/ldap2pg](https://labs.dalibo.com/ldap2pg).


## ldap2pg 5.0

Released 2019-08-26.

- Fix default ldap settings overriding ldaprc values.
- Allow joining LDAP entries based on DN attributes, e.g. to support role name
  synchronization using the Active Directory (AD) attributes `sAMAccountName`
  or `userPrincipalName`.
- Let user choose psycopg2 distribution. Affects only pip.
- Support GSSAPI authentification for Kerberos. Thanks @djkube for testing.


## ldap2pg 4.18

- Fix ref discarding.
- Ship official docker image: dalibo/ldap2pg.
- Parse LDAP settings from YAML too.


## ldap2pg 4.17

- Fix broken `__usage_on_types__`. Replaced by `__default_usage_on_types__`.
- Gently raise connection errors.
- Warn on possible typo in config key.


## ldap2pg 4.16

- Allow to customize comment on role creation.
- Fix decoding Postgres error with utf-8 chars.
- Include foreign tables in inspect ON ALL TABLES grants.


## ldap2pg 4.15

- Add Amazon RDS admin roles in default blacklist.
- Skip `pg_temp_*` and `pg_toast_temp_*` schemas when inspecting grants.
- Fix schema naïve privilege inspection.
- Fix newly created roles excluded from privilege inspection.
- Time LDAP searches, Postgres inspection and Postgres synchronization. Time
  delta are shown in debug messages.
- Trace maximum memory used in debug message.
- Reduce memory usage of grants and roles.


## ldap2pg 4.14

- Allow to exclude public from managed roles. When scoping ldap2pg to a subset
  of roles, ldap2pg was including the public role, always. Now you can include
  or exclude public by using `managed_roles_query` parameter. If you customized
  `managed_roles_query` you **must update ldap2pg.yml** to include `public` to
  keep the same behaviour. See [Synchronize a subset of
  roles](postgres.md#synchronize-a-subset-of-roles) documentation section.


## ldap2pg 4.13

- Allow to configure behaviour on unexpected DN. Current behaviour are `ignore`,
  `warn` and `fail`. If a LDAP attribute has references different objectClass,
  accessing a RDN triggers an error. The `on_unexpected_dn` configuration key
  allows to configure this behaviour.
- LDAPREFERRALS is now disabled by default, just like ldapsearch and other
  openldap tools. You must explicitly enable REFERRALS with `LDAPREFERRALS=yes`
  env var, or `REFERRALS yes` ldap.conf(1) parameter.


## ldap2pg 4.12

- Fix Bad search filter when using multiline YAML string.
- Fix support for Postgres 9.3.


## ldap2pg 4.11
