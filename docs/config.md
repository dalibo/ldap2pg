<h1><tt>ldap2pg.yml</tt></h1>

`ldap2pg` accepts a YAML configuration file usually named `ldap2pg.yml` and put
in working directory. Everything can be configured from the YAML file:
verbosity, LDAP and Postgres credentials, LDAP queries, privileges and
mappings.

!!! warning

    `ldap2pg` **requires** a config file where the synchronization map
    is described.


## File Location

`ldap2pg` searches for files in the following order :

1. `ldap2pg.yml` in current working directory.
2. `~/.config/ldap2pg.yml`.
3. `/etc/ldap2pg.yml`.

If `LDAP2PG_CONFIG` or `--config` is set, `ldap2pg` skip searching the standard
file locations. You can specify `-` to read configuration from standard input.
This is helpful to feed `ldap2pg` with dynamic configuration.


## File Structure & Example

`ldap2pg.yml` is split in several sections :

- `postgres` : setup Postgres connexion and inspection queries.
- `ldap` : setup LDAP connexion.
- `privileges` : the definition of privileges.
- `sync_map` : the list of LDAP queries and associated mapping to roles and
  grants.
- finally some global parameters (verbosity, etc.).

We provide a simple well commented
[ldap2pg.yml](https://github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/blob/master/ldap2pg.yml), tested
on CI. If you don't know how to begin, it can be a good starting point.

!!! note

    If you have trouble finding the right configuration for your needs, feel free to
    [file an issue](https://github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/issues/new) to get help.


## About YAML

YAML is a super-set of JSON. A JSON document is a valid YAML document. YAML very
permissive format where indentation is meaningful. See [this YAML
cheatsheet](https://medium.com/@kenichishibata/yaml-to-json-cheatsheet-c3ac3ef519b8)
for some example.


## Postgres Parameters

The `postgres` section defines connection parameters and SQL queries for
Postgres inspection.

The `postgres` section contains several `*_query` parameters. These parameters
can be either a string containing an SQL query or a YAML list to return a
static list of values.


### `dsn`

Specifies a PostgreSQL connexion URI.

``` yaml
postgres:
  dsn: postgres://user@%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fpostgresql:port/
```

!!! warning

    `ldap2pg` refuses to read a password from a group readable or world
    readable `ldap2pg.yml`.


### `databases_query`

The SQL query to list databases in the cluster. This defaults to all databases
connectable, thus including `template1`. You can override this with a YAML
list like other queries.

``` yaml
postgres:
  databases_query: "SELECT datname FROM pg_catalog.pg_databases;"
  # OR
  databases_query: [mydb]
```


### `managed_roles_query`

The SQL query to list the name of managed roles. ldap2pg restricts role
deletion and privilege edition to managed roles. Usualy, this query returns
children of a dedicated group like `ldap_roles`. By default, all roles found
are managed.

`public` is a special builtin role in Postgres. If `managed_roles_query`
returns `public` role in the list, ldap2pg will manage privileges on `public`.

``` yaml
postgres:
  managed_roles_query: |
    SELECT 'public'
    UNION
    SELECT DISTINCT role.rolname
    FROM pg_roles AS role
    LEFT OUTER JOIN pg_auth_members AS ms ON ms.member = role.oid
    LEFT OUTER JOIN pg_roles AS ldap_roles
      ON ldap_roles.rolname = 'ldap_roles' AND ldap_roles.oid = ms.roleid
    WHERE role.rolname = 'ldap_roles' OR ldap_roles.oid IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY 1;
```


### `owners_query`

The SQL query to global list the names of object owners. ldap2pg execute this
query *once*, after all roles are created, before granting and revoking
privileges. You need this query only if you manage default privileges with
ldap2pg.

``` yaml
postgres:
  owners_query: |
    SELECT role.rolname
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_roles AS role
    WHERE role.rolsuper IS TRUE;
```

You can declare per-schema owners with `schemas_query`. However, unlike
`owners_query`, `schemas_query` is executed *before* creating users.


### `roles_blacklist_query`

The SQL query returning name and glob pattern to blacklist role from
management. ldap2pg won't touch anything on these roles.

``` yaml
postgres:
  roles_blacklist_query:
  - postgres
  - pg_*
  - rds_*
  - "rds*admin"
```

Beware that `*suffix` is a YAML reference. You must quote pattern beginning
with `*`.


### `roles_query`

The SQL query returning all roles, their options and their members. It's not
very useful to customize this. Prefer configure `roles_blacklist_query` and
`managed_roles_query` to reduce synchronization to a subset of roles.

Role's options varies from one PostgreSQL version to another. ldap2pg handle
this by injecting options columns in `{options}` substitution.

``` yaml
postgres:
  roles_query: |
    SELECT
        role.rolname, array_agg(members.rolname) AS members,
        {options},
        pg_catalog.shobj_description(role.oid, 'pg_authid') as comment
    FROM
        pg_catalog.pg_roles AS role
    LEFT JOIN pg_catalog.pg_auth_members ON roleid = role.oid
    LEFT JOIN pg_catalog.pg_roles AS members ON members.oid = member
    GROUP BY role.rolname, {options}, comment
    ORDER BY 1;
```


### `schemas_query`

The SQL query returning the name of schemas in a database. ldap2pg execute this
query on each databases returned by `databases_query`. ldap2pg loops on objects
in theses schemas when inspecting GRANTs in the cluster.

``` yaml
postgres:
  schemas_query: |
    SELECT nspname FROM pg_catalog.pg_namespace
```


## `ldap` section

The LDAP section is fairly simple. Not to be confused with `ldap` query section
in `sync_map` (See below). The top-level `ldap` section is meant only to gather
LDAP connexion informations.

``` yaml
ldap:
  uri: ldap://ldap2pg.local:389
  binddn: cn=admin,dc=ldap2pg,dc=local
  # For SASL
  user: saslusername
  password: SECRET
```

Actually, it's better to configure ldap connexion through `ldaprc` and regular
libldap environment variables than in YAML. See ldap.conf(1) for details. The
best practice is to configure ldapsearch and then ldap2pg must be configured as
well like any other libldap tool. If not, please open an issue.

ldap2pg accepts an extra `LDAPPASSWORD` environment variable.


## `privileges` section

This top level section is a directory defining high-level privilege, referenced
in Synchronisation map `grant` directive.

An entry in `privileges` is either a list of other privileges or a definition
of a custom privilege. A privilege whose name starts with `_` is inactive but
available for inclusion in a privilege group. This allows ldap2pg to ships
[well-known privileges](wellknown.md) waiting to be included in your high-level
privilege.

``` yaml
privileges:
  privgroup:
  - __select_on_tables__
  - __connect__
  - custompriv

  custompriv:
    type: datacl
    inspect: SELECT ...
    grant: GRANT ...
    revoke: REVOKE ...
```

Writing a custom privilege is hard. Before writing one, ensure that it's not
already builtin ldap2pg [well-known privileges](wellknown.md). Please open an
issue if you need a builtin privilege, and share your work. This will increase
the quality of privilege handling in ldap2pg.


### `type`

Privilege can be of different kind. The type of privilege influence whether
ldap2pg should loops on databases, schemas or owners roles. This influences
also the parameters required to define a grant.

``` yaml
privileges:
  custom:
    type: datacl
```

See [Privilege documentation](privileges.md) for details.


### `inspect`

The SQL query to inspect grants of this privilege in the cluster. This
signature of tuples returned by this query varies after privilege type. This
query may be executed once for global objects or per database, depending on
privilege type.

``` yaml
privileges:
  custom:
    inspect: |
      SELECT grantee FROM ...
```

This is the trickiest query to write when synchronizing privileges. See
[Privilege documentation](privileges.md) for details.


### `grant`

SQL query to grant a privilege to a role. Some parameters are injected in this
query using mustache substitution like `{role}`. Parameters depends on
privilege type. For example, a defacl privileges must accepts an `{owner}`
parameter.

This option must not be confused with `grant` directive in synchronisation map.

``` yaml
privileges:
  custom:
    grant: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA {schema} TO {role};
```

See [Privilege documentation](privileges.md) for details.


### `revoke`

Just like `grant` ; the SQL query to revoke a privilege from a role. Parameters
are substituted with mustache syntax like `{role}` and depends on privilege
type. You must reuse the same parameters as in `grant` query.

``` yaml
privileges:
  custom:
    revoke: REVOKE SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA {schema} FROM {role};
```

See [Privilege documentation](privileges.md) for details.


## `sync_map`

The synchronization map is a YAML list. We call each item a *mapping*. A
mapping is a YAML dict with a `description` field and any of `ldap`, `role` and
`grant` subsection.

``` yaml
sync_map:
- description: "Define DBA roles"
  ldap:
    base: ...
  roles:
  - name: "{cn}"
    options: LOGIN SUPERUSER
```

The `ldap` subsection is optional. You can define roles and grants without
querying a directory.


### `ldap` directive

This directive defines LDAP search parameters. Not to be confused with
top-level `ldap` section defining LDAP connexion parameters.


### `base`, `scope` and `filter`

These parameters have the same meaning, definition and default as ldapsearch
searchbase, scope and filter arguments.

``` yaml
sync_map:
- ldap:
    base: ou=people,dc=company,dc=tld
    scope: sub
    filter: >
      (&
         (member=*)
         (cn=group_*)
      )
```

ldap2pg infers attributes from role and grant directives. You don't have to
define them in `ldap` search directive.


### `joins`

Customize sub-query. In some case, ldap2pg needs to issue a sub-query to
further access attributes of an LDAP entry referenced in a top-level entry.
Usually, `member` attribute is a reference and if you need `sAMAccountName` on
each member, inject it with `{member.sAMAccountName}` and ldap2pg will
automatically trigger a sub-query.

ldap2pg supports only one sub-query per attribute. The `joins` section is a
dictionary with attribute name as key and LDAP search parameters as value.

``` yaml
sync_map:
- ldap:
    joins:
      member:
        filter: ...
        scope: ...
```

The search base of sub-query is the value of the referencing attribute, e.g.
each value of `member`. Again, ldap2pg infers attributes of sub-queries.

See [Querying LDAP](ldap.md) for details.


### `on_unexpected_dn`

Sometimes, an attribute references another entry in LDAP rather than specifying
a value. This mixed types attributes are hard to handle and must be avoided.

The `on_unexpected_dn` parameter allows you to tell ldap2pg how to behave it
this case. The default is to fail. You can choose to either `warn` or silently
`ignore` these values.

``` yaml
sync_map:
- ldap:
    on_unexpected_dn: warn  # fail | warn | ignore
```


### `role` rule

Define one or more roles wanted in the cluster. This includes name, options,
comment and members. `roles` is an alias for this key. The value can be either
a single role rule or a list of role rules.

``` yaml
sync_map:
- role:
    name: dba
    options: SUPERUSER LOGIN
- roles:
  - name: rw
    options: NOLOGIN
  - name: ro
    options: NOLOGIN
```


### `name`

One or more role name wanted in the cluster. `names` is an alias for this
parameter. The value can be either a single string or a list of strings. You
can inject LDAP attributes in name using curly braces.

``` yaml
sync_map:
- roles:
  - name: "{cn}"
```


## Shortcuts

If the file is a YAML list, `ldap2pg` puts the list as `sync_map`. The two
following configurations are strictly equivalent:

``` console
$ ldap2pg -c -
- admin
$ ldap2pg -c -
sync_map:
- roles:
  - names:
    - admin
$
```

`database`, `schema`, `role`, `name`, `parent` and `member` can be either a
string or a list of strings. These keys have plural aliases, respectively
`databases`, `schema`, `roles`, `names`, `parents` and `members`.
