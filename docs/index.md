Postgres is able to check password of an existing role using the LDAP protocol out of the box.
ldap2pg automates the creation, update and removal of PostgreSQL roles and users from an entreprise directory.

Managing roles is close to managing privileges as you expect roles to have proper default privileges.
ldap2pg can grant and revoke privileges too.
