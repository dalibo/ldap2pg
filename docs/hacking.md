<h1>Hacking</h1>

You are welcome to contribute to ldap2pg with patch to code, documentation or configuration sample !
Here is an extended documentation on how to setup *a* development environment.
Feel free to adapt to your cumfort.
Automatic tests on CircleCI will take care of validating regressions.


## Docker Development Environment

Project repository ships a `docker-compose.yml` file to launch an Samba Directory and a PostgreSQL instances.

``` console
$ docker compose pull
...
Status: Downloaded newer image for postgres:16-alpine
$ docker compose up -d
Creating network "ldap2pg_default" with the default driver
Creating ldap2pg_postgres_1 ...
Creating ldap2pg_samba_1 ...
Creating ldap2pg_postgres_1
Creating ldap2pg_samba_1 ... done
```

It's up to you to define how to access Postgres and LDAP containers from your host:
either use DNS resolution or a `docker-compose.override.yml` to expose port on your host.
Provided `docker-compose.yml` comes with `postgres.ldap2pg.docker` and `samba.ldap2pg.docker` [dnsdock](https://github.com/aacebedo/dnsdock) aliases.

Setup your environment with regular `PG*` envvars so that `psql` can just connect to your PostgreSQL instance.
Check with a simple `psql` invocation.

``` console
$ export PGHOST=postgres.ldap2pg.docker PGUSER=postgres PGPASSWORD=postgres
$ psql -c 'SELECT version()';
```

Do the same to setup `libldap2` with `LDAP*` envvars.
A `ldaprc` is provided setting up `BINDDN` and `BASE`.
ldap2pg supports `LDAPPASSWORD` to set password from env.
Check it with `ldapsearch`:

``` console
$ export LDAPURI=ldaps://samba.ldap2pg.docker LDAPPASSWORD=1Ntegral
$ ldapsearch -vxw $LDAPPASSWORD -s base cn
ldap_initialize( <DEFAULT> )
filter: (objectclass=*)
requesting: cn
# extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
# base <cn=users,dc=bridoulou,dc=fr> (default) with scope baseObject
# filter: (objectclass=*)
# requesting: cn
#

# Users, bridoulou.fr
dn: CN=Users,DC=bridoulou,DC=fr
cn: Users

# search result
search: 2
result: 0 Success

# numResponses: 2
# numEntries: 1
$
```

### Environement without DNS resolution

To access Samba Directory and PostgreSQL without dnsdock,
exposes containers ports to your host with the following override:

``` yaml
# contents docker-compose.override.yml
version: '3'

services:
  samba:
    ports:
      # HOST:CONTAINER
      - 389:389
      - 636:636

  postgres:
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
```

Use `PGHOST=localhost` and `LDAPURI=ldaps://localhost`.


### Running ldap2pg with Changes

Now you can run ldap2pg from source and test your changes!

``` console
$ go run .
09:54:27 INFO   Starting ldap2pg                                 version=v6.0-alpha5 runtime=go1.20.3 commit=<none>
09:54:27 WARN   Running a prerelease! Use at your own risks!
09:54:27 INFO   Using YAML configuration file.                   path=./ldap2pg.yml
...
09:54:27 INFO   Nothing to do.                                   elapsed=78.470278ms mempeak=1.2MiB postgres=0s queries=0 ldap=486.921µs searches=1
$
```

## Development Fixtures

ldap2pg project comes with three cases for testing:

  - nominal: a regular case with:
    - running unprivileged
    - a single database named `nominal`.
    - 3 groupes : readers, writers and owners
    - roles and privileges synchronized.
  - extra: few corner cases together
    - running as superuser
    - synchronize role configuration
    - do LDAP sub-searches.
  - big: a huge synchronization project
    - multiple databases with a LOT of schemas, tables, views, etc.
    - all privileges synchronized
    - 3 groups per schemas.
    - 1K users in directory.

`test/fixtures/` holds fixtures for Samba and PostgreSQL.
Default development environment loads *nominal* and *extra* fixtures.
By default, big case is not loaded.
Func tests use *nominal* and *extra* fixtures.
See below for *big* case.

`test/fixtures/postgres/reset.sh` resets PostgreSQL state.
You can also use `make reset-postgres` to recreate PostgreSQL container from scratch.


## Unit tests

Unit tests strictly have **no I/O**.
Run unit tests as usual go tests.

``` console
$ go test ./...
?       github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/cmd/render-doc        [no test files]
ok      github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/cmd/mon-dojo  0.002s
ok      github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/internal      0.003s
ok      github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/internal/config       0.007s
ok      github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/internal/inspect      0.005s
ok      github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/internal/ldap 0.005s
ok      github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/internal/lists        0.005s

ok      github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/internal/tree 0.002s
ok      github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/internal/wanted       0.003s
$
```


## Functionnal tests

`test/` directory is a [pytest] project with functionnal tests.
Functionnal tests tend to validate ldap2pg in real world : **no mocks**.

Func tests requires Python 3.6.
Create a virtualenv to isolate ldap2pg dev Python dependencies.
Install dev dependencies with `pip install -Ur test/requirements.txt`.


``` console
$ pip install -Ur test/requirements.txt
...
Successfully installed iniconfig-2.0.0 packaging-23.1 pluggy-1.3.0 pytest-7.4.2 sh-1.14.1
$
```

You can run func tests right from you development environment:


``` console
$ pip install -Ur test/requirements.txt
...
$ pytest test/
...
ldap2pg: /home/bersace/src/dalibo/ldap2pg/test/ldap2pg.sh
...
test/test_nominal.py::test_re_revoke PASSED                                  [ 90%]
test/test_nominal.py::test_nothing_to_do PASSED                              [100%]

=============================== 11 passed in 14.90s ================================
$
```

CI executes func tests in CentOS 6 and 7 and RockyLinux 8 and 9.

Tests are written with the great [pytest](https://doc.pytest.org) and [sh](https://amoffat.github.io/sh/) projects.
`conftest.py` provides various specific fixtures.
The most important is that Postgres database is reset between each Python **module**.
pytests executes Func tests in definition order.
If a test modifies Postgres, the following tests will have this modification kept until the end of the module.
This allows to split a big scenario in severals steps without loosing context and CPU cycle.

Two main pytest fixtures are very useful when testing: `psql` and `ldap`.
These little helpers provide fastpath to frequent inspection of Postgres database on LDAP base with `sh.py`-style API.

You can execute tests just like in CI with the following commands:

``` console
$ goreleaser build --clean --snapshot --single-target
$ COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:test/docker-compose.yml docker compose up --exit-code-from=test
```

## Big Case

To stress ldap2pg on big setup, use `make big`.
This will feed directory with a lot of users and groups, several databases with a lot of schemas, etc.
Synchronize this setup with:

``` console
$ test/genbigconfig.sh | PGDATABASE=big0 go run . -c -
```


## Documenting

Building documentation requires Python 3.7.
[mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) is in charge of building the documentation.
To edit the doc, install `docs/requirements.txt` and run `mkdocs serve` at the toplevel directory.
See [mkdocs documentation](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/) for further information.

``` console
$ pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
...
Successfully installed babel-2.12.1 certifi-2023.7.22 charset-normalizer-3.2.0 click-8.1.7 colorama-0.4.6 ghp-import-2.1.0 idna-3.4 jinja2-3.1.2 markdown-3.5 m...
```


## Releasing

- Update default.pgo
- Review `docs/changelog.md`.
  First title must be `# ldap2pg X.Y`
- Generate release commit, tag and changelog with `make release`.
  make reads next version from changelog.
- Once CircleCI has created GitHub release artifacts, publish packages with `make publish-packages`.
- Once Docker Hub has published new tag, tag latest image on docker hub with `make tag-latest`.
