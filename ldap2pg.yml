#
# **LDAP2PG SAMPLE CONFIGURATION**
#
# This is a sample starting point configuration file for ldap2pg.yml. Including
# static roles, groups, privilege and LDAP query.
#
# This configuration assumes the following principles:
#
# - All LDAP users are grouped in `ldap_roles` group.
# - Read privileges are granted to `readers` group.
# - Write privileges are granted to `writers` group.
# - DDL privileges are granted to `owners` group.
# - We have one or more databases with public and maybe a schema.
# - Grants are not specific to a schema. Once you're writer in a database, you
#   are writer to all schemas in it.
#
# Adapt to your needs! See also full documentation on how to configure ldap2pg
# at https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config/.
