# This is a starting point configuration file for ldap2pg.yml. Including static
# roles, groups, privilege and LDAP query.
#
# This configuration assumes the following principles:
#
# - All LDAP users are grouped in `ldap_roles` group.
# - Read privileges are granted to `readers` group.
# - Write privileges are granted to `writers` group.
# - DDL privileges are granted to `owners` group.
# - We have one or more databases with public and maybe a schema.
# - Grants are not specific to a schema. Once you're writer in a database, you
#   are writer to all schemas in it.
#
# The LDAP directory content is described in fixtures/openldap-data.ldif
#
# Adapt to your needs! See also full documentation on how to configure ldap2pg
# at https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config/.
#
# Don't hesitate to suggest improvements for this starting configuration at
# https://github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/issues/new . Thanks for your contribution !
